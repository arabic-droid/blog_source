I've been meaning to get around to writing a good tutorial on c# background workers. Mainly because I use them to separate the GUI from all the heavy lifting and I always forget how to update things.

In case I never get around to it. [This is about the clearest introduction I've ever found.](http://dotnetperls.com/backgroundworker) Well worth a read...
