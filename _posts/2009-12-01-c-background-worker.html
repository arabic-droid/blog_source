I've been meaning to get around to writing a good tutorial on c# background workers. Mainly because I use them to separate the GUI from all the heavy lifting and I always forget how to update things.<br /><br />In case I never get around to it. <a href="http://dotnetperls.com/backgroundworker">This</a> is about the clearest introduction I've ever found. Well worth a read...
