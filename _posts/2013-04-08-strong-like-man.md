The death of Thatcher prompted [a short conversation on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kianryan/status/321242678677356544) which included this tweet...

But ever since I watched my wife-unit squeeze out two children (and perhaps since they were both girls) I have become even more confused by our societies approach to women.

(Sorry, the links below are almost all behind paywalls. Blame academia not me)

You see ["Gender differences in mathematics performance are small."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2138794) There are ["no noteworthy sex differences in social anxiety, impulsiveness, activity, ideas (e.g., reflectiveness), locus of control, and orderliness."](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=1995-09434-001) And while it does seem to be true that men take more risks than women this ["gender gap seems to be growing smaller over time."](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=1999-13573-004)

Also, despite it being popular to say that women talk more [there don't actually seem to be any significant differences in verbal ability between genders.](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=1988-35304-001)

From the word go we teach our children, consciously or not, that they should behave appropriately to their gender. I once watched two dads chase their two year old boys across a garden to stop them playing with a pram and a doll.

One ray of hope is that a few of the linked studies suggest that gender differences are growing smaller over time. Perhaps it is because we're getting better at being equal but maybe the researchers are less biased or controlling for it better now than they were thirty years ago.

Apocryphally we all "know" that men are stronger than women generally and [it is the case that men tend to be bigger and have greater muscle mass which equates to greater physical strength](http://jap.physiology.org/content/83/5/1581.full). But I work with female climbers who could totally squash me if they wanted to. So probably it's more true that people who exercise are stronger.

So, is that what's happening? Do we just link greater physical strength with greater everything else?

Is that why my daughters are, accounting for productivity, less likely to be promoted and [likely to have a 20% lower salary](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00483.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) (right now the eldest is five and I don't pay her anything so who am I to complain)?

That's pretty rubbish, isn't it? That because you're likely to grow fewer muscle fibres and shorter bones you *matter* less (apologies for the pun).

I think it's brilliant that the UK had a female PM but it's a real shame if the woman herself didn't realise that by 'being strong like a man' she was simply 'being strong'.

Anyway fellas think honestly about this final question: "When you are working, voting or paying your bills do you use your penis?" I'm guessing that like *most* men the answer is that you don't... which means that activity could just as easily have been done by someone without a penis.

That's my definition of feminism and that's why I'm a feminist. Male Chauvinism is simply bollocks (I can't be the first person to make that joke, right?)

  I moved my blog from Blogger to GitHub pages. As ugly as it is I've carried the comments on this post over to keep the record...

    To clarify that tweet:

    "Even worse, she believed that women should act like men to be strong. Which to become PM, she had to do."

    She had to act like a man to give the impression of masculinity to rise through the political ladder and reach the office of PM.

    140 characters is a little limiting.

    Maggie was no feminist.  She believed that power was only really taken from masculinity, not unlike Lady Macbeth:

    "Come, you spirits
    
    That tend on mortal thoughts,

    unsex me here,  

    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full  

    Of direst cruelty!

    make thick my blood;"

    And she even says as such:

    "The feminists hate me, don’t they? And I don’t blame them. For I hate feminism. It is poison."

    People describe her as having broken through the glass ceiling, not only for being the first female PM, but for being a PM from a working class background.  That much is true, but she did under the pretence of masculinity and did a damn good job of bricking up the path behind her to ensure non could follow.

    Not in any way, shape, or form do I believe that women are less strong, powerful, or important than men.  Far from it, but feminine attributes are significantly less valued by society than their masculine counterparts, even in the 2010s.  In the 1980s, the only way for Maggie to have climbed the political ladder was as men do.

    Yep, it's awful how masculinity is so much more valued! 

    And how having a female PM didn't take away from that (or at least as much as I'd have liked it to). 

    We lose so much by politics being such a boys club.
