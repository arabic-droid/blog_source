    <br />This post is part of a series where I'm hoping to prove to myself that building a dynamic website without a CMS platform is comparable to building one with a known CMS. <a href="http://mindlessramblingnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/websites-cms.html">See the first post for an explanation of why</a>

    <h1 style="clear: both;">Storing Data</h1>
    <div>After a day writing DDL for a project that has manual schema versioning against MS SQL and is going through a lot of changes I feel honour bound to write a post about storing data in the Omniclopse site.</div>
    <div>
        <br />
    </div>
    <div>I'll be using MongoDB for two reasons.&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        <br />
    </div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>The implicit schema of a NoSQL database is awesome when you're not sure of the final shape of the data.</li>
            <li>Storing a data structure that's almost definitely going to be sent over the wire as JSON as... JSON makes a lot of sense to me.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h1>First Steps</h1>
    <div>At least for now each view will have its own document in the database (At the moment there's only one view! so why complicate things).
