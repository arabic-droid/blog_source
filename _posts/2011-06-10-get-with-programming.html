Vodafone (displayed here) and 3...<br /><br />When I type a phone number I split it into three sections using white space. "nnnn nnn nnnn" that's how I remember numbers. That's not uncommon I don't think... nor is it odd to use a dash.<br /><br />So why do I need to learn how your website wants phone numbers formatted.<br /><br />Whack some javascript on your page... you *must* be using it for something!<br /><br />var correctedNumber = numberTypedOnForm.replace(" ","").replace("-","");<br /><br />and with that massive development cost you aren't going to make someone type a number twice just to satisfy your database server. Yes, not everyone will have javascript turned on and it won't catch everyone's weird way of typing phone numbers<br /><br />"(nnnn)-nn-nn-nn-n" <br /><br />but it's about not introducing a pain point for customers when you don't have to<br /><br /><br />If you want to be really fancy you could<br /><br />var correctedNumber = numberTypedOnForm.replace("/\D/g","");<br /><br />Computers are supposed to make our lives easier but it's up to *you* website developers to help them help us.<br /><br />Arseholes!
