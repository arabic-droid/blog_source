Over the last two days I've been researching using Windows Deployment Services with BDD. I've got 4 workstations to build so I may as well investigate it right?

I am also updating my main machine from build 7100 of Win 7 Ultimate to the RTM so I have a Win XP box on my desk that I've built to give me continuity and a new Win 7 install.<br /><br />Both of which had Bing as the default search engine out of the box.<br /><br />So I thought I'd run with it. After all I'm searching for Microsoft technologies...<br /><br />The first hit from the string "BDD 2007 download" in Google is:<br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=02A2605D-51E8-469F-BE4A-1DD2AF580502&displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=02A2605D-51E8-469F-BE4A-1DD2AF580502&displaylang=en</a><br /><br />That's the download page for BDD 2007 on Microsoft's site.<br /><br />The first hit from the same string on Bing.com is:<br /><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/desktopdeployment/default.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/desktopdeployment/default.aspx</a><br /><br />That's not the BDD 2007 page and I can't even see a BDD link on there.<br /><br />Bad, bad, bad and bad. I think that's a reasonable search string when I want to download BDD 2007 and clearly so does google whereas Bing seems to think I want to hit some generic gront end and read lots of whitepapers... <br /><br />That's why I think of Google as a productivity tool.
