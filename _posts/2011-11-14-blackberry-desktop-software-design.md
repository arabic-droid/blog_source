OK, so maybe the title is an overstatement but here's the steps to reach that mindset.

<ol><li>My boss goes and gets a new blackberry (he really likes his old Blackberry so he gets a shiny new one)</li><li>He installs Blackberry Desktop Software on his Mac (I think that he has a Mac is beside the point)</li><li>He has 5 contacts in his Mac address book. He doesn't know that. He doesn't use it.</li><li>He plugs in his old phone</li><li>The above dialogue pops up.</li><li>He isn't an IT savvy person so he accepts the recommended option</li><li>The software deletes all his phone contacts and puts the 5 mystery contacts on the device</li><li>He plugs in his new phone expecting to be able to copy all of his contacts on to it.</li></ol><div>Yes, he should have had a backup. Yes, reading that dialogue as a tech-savvy person I can translate what it is going to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>But, come on Blackberry - it *never*&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to you that someone might have a phone for a while before they install the desktop software? You *never* considered that users click the recommended option expecting it to be in some vague and nebulous way they won't be able to properly describe "better" and hence deserving of recommendation?</div><div><br /></div><div>You don't think that something like this might be in order...</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zq2sOQ7Lrfo/TsEty-rHITI/AAAAAAAAAWg/q3GtHED8V1I/s1600/mockup_5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zq2sOQ7Lrfo/TsEty-rHITI/AAAAAAAAAWg/q3GtHED8V1I/s1600/mockup_5.png" /></a></div><br /></div><div>Honestly, it's no skin off my nose. I don't like the UI of Blackberries and I think the whole infrastructure is a bit too crappy. But my boss? Well, at one point he was pushing for all business mobiles to be Blackberries. Now he's looking at my iPhone and asking interested questions.</div><div><br /></div><div>If he had an Android we'd still have his contacts</div><div>If he had an iPhone we'd still have his contacts</div><div>If he had a Windows Phone (hell even WinMo 6) we'd still have his contacts</div><div><br /></div><div>Remind me again what recommends your products... oh yeah it's a phone that does email. If only it was still ten years ago and that was a USP</div>
